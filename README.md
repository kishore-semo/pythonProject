# Required Additions
- Create a high score table which is stored in a file at the end of each game. It should keep track of the top 10 player, listing their score and their initials.
- Add a display before the game begins which shows the high score table. The table should vanish when the game begins.
- Display the high score table after the game over screen.
- Display text to ask the player if they want to play again on the game over screen. Let the player select yes or no. If they select yes, restart the game. If they select no, exit the program.
- Add one other game play element of your choosing to the game. You could add some sort of enemy, powerups, or some sort of asset changes. Be creative!
